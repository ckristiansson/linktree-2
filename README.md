# Linktree, version 2

Another version of a linktree interface, this time with a more playful design and the use of flexgrid.

In this project I've primarily focused on working with SCSS and tried to implement some of its features.

Keep in mind you will need to compile this with SCSS or the design will not show properly.

Underneath if a screenshot of the design.
